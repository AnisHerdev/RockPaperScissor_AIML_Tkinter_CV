Hand Gesture Recognition with Mediapipe

- basicClassification.py: Implements a simple classification model for hand gestures. This script is useful for testing basic classification algorithms on the dataset.  
- tkinterApp.py: Provides a GUI application using Tkinter to interact with the hand gesture recognition system. Users can load models, test gestures, and view results through the interface.  
- reinforcementLearningtest.py: Explores reinforcement learning techniques for gesture recognition. This script is experimental and demonstrates how RL can be applied to improve gesture classification.  
- keypoint_classification_EN.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of keypoint-based gesture classification. It includes data visualization, feature extraction, and model training steps.  

Steps to Run the Scripts:

1. Run Basic Classification  
    To test the basic classification model, execute:  
    python basicClassification.py
    This script will output the classification results and basic performance metrics.  

2. Launch the Tkinter GUI  
    Run the Tkinter-based GUI application with:  
    python tkinterApp.py
    Follow the on-screen instructions to load a model and test gestures.  

3. Test Reinforcement Learning  
    To experiment with reinforcement learning for gesture recognition, run:  
    python reinforcementLearningtest.py  
    This script will output the results of the RL-based approach.  

4. Use the Jupyter Notebook  
    Open the `keypoint_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:  
    jupyter notebook keypoint_classification.ipynb  
    Follow the cells step-by-step to understand the keypoint-based classification process.
