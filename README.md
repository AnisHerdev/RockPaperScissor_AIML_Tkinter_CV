# Hand Gesture Recognition with MediaPipe

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using Google's MediaPipe framework. It leverages machine learning to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Utilizes MediaPipe's pre-trained models for efficient processing.
- Easy to integrate into other applications.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnisHerdev/RockPaperScissor_AIML_Tkinter_CV.git
    cd hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv myenv
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the hand gesture recognition:
```bash
python tkinterApp.py
```
